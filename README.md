# Tic-Tac-Toe
The basic 0's and X's game. This is the Player VS Computer version.

The user plays with X and computer plays with 0. User tries to fill 3 X's in a straight line, horizontal, vertical or diagonal, and computer tries to fill 3 0's. The player who is able to do so first, wins. If the 3x3 square does not have any space left and there is no winner, then the game is a draw.
The winner of the last game gets the first move, user in case its the first game.

The computer might not be a very easy player to defeat. He will show you stars as soon as you take him for granted.
